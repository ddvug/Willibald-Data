# Test data for Roadshow

This directory contains all relevant files (DDL and data) for the roadshow test data. The three directories each reflect a complete delivery for that day. The description of the data model can be found in the directory ../Data model. The days correspond to the deliveries of the test data from the web shop (period 1 ~ day 1)

Notes on the test data:

There is currently only one error in the roadshow data. In the delivery of day 3, 2 IDs from the data of day 2 are 'reused'. This is a data quality problem that should not actually occur...
