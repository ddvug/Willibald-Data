# Hints and Fixes during DWA Challenge



## Hints

1. Please use the schema without constraints for the load
   There is always a  schema file with 

   ```
   '_[webshop|roadshow]_DDL_[day#].sql'
   ```

   that can be used for that.





## Fixes

- 11.1.23 
  Wrong name and datatype in day 2 of roadshow
  changed the order of the csv file to match the order in the schema of RS_Bestellung

  

- 12.1.23
  Namechange on the 10 days early entry in the historized reference table Termintreue (description and excel file)
